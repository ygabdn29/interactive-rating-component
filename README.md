## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I'm exercising what I have learned about using Javascript to create a more versatile web pages, like using it to hide and show some element and saving value from a markup element so that I can use it to create a new element containing said value. Aside from that, in this challenge I tried mobile-first when developing the solution and keeps on exercising my css layouting skill using flexbox and grid.
